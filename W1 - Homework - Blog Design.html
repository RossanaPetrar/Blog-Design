      <h1>Rules for Autocomplete</h1>
      <p id="datePosted">
        Posted on
        <time>March 19, 2019</time>
      </p>
      <p class="bodyText">
        Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to
        solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I see this frequently enough
        that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I’d just
        write down the set of rules they often break.
      </p>
      <p class="bodyText">
        There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to
        do, but there should be a good reason for breaking one of these rules
        (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must be filled
        with a value from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following
        these rules should always result in at very least a sane experience:
      </p>
      <ul type="disc" class="bodyList">
        <li>
          Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option
          exactly, other options must always go below the one matching what they
          typed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I
          want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”
        </li>
        <li>
          After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting
          with substring matches would almost always be the wrong thing to do
          since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the
          middle.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to
          subsequence matching. This is only useful in some cases
        </li>
        <li>
          If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall
          back to approximate matches. This is rarely necessary to provide.
        </li>
        <li>Matches should be sorted alphabetically.</li>
        <li>
          When one option is the prefix of another, put the shortest one first.
        </li>
        <li>
          The matching should probably be case insensitive unless there are two
          options that differ only by case. In that case (pun intended), prefer
          the one that more closely matches the user’s input.
        </li>
        <li>
          The action to make use of the selection (e.g. to search the term) must
          be a different key than the action to accept the first suggestion
          unless you have to do something first to start using autocomplete
          suggestions (e.g. hit the down arrow). The user should never have to
          take extra steps to not use autocomplete.
        </li>
        <li>
          The tab key should always accept the current autocomplete option, if
          there is one (whether it is highlighted in a dropdown or suggested
          inline).
        </li>
        <li>
          If an autocomplete selection is highlighted, pressing enter should
          always make use of that selection. It should never revert to a default
          selection, even if part of the page is loading. If something is still
          loading, it is better to ignore the enter press than to navigate to
          the wrong destination.
        </li>
        <li>
          Autocomplete should almost never activate on keypresses when the field
          using autocomplete is not focused.
        </li>
        <li>The results should come in <100ms in the common case.</li>
        <li>
          It’s OK to pause autocompleting when the user is rapidly typing
          additional letters, but don’t show results from the middle of that
          burst of letters after the user has finished typing. It’s better to
          wait longer and change the results once than to show results that
          appear finished but aren’t. (I admit that this rule is quite
          subjective.)
        </li>
        <li>
          If an option is highlighted, never change it, even if new data is
          loaded.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="bodyText">
        There are some optional features that make sense in certain kinds of
        autocompletion and not others. I’m sure there are more correct names for
        these features than what I listed.
      </p>
      <ul type="disc" class="bodyList">
        <li>
          Show options I’ve used before when I focus the field but haven’t
          entered anything yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Autocompletion to the nearest ambiguous prefix. If I type “g” and that
          matches both “Google” and “GoodReads”, this operation would fill in
          the two “o”s, allowing me to then type either “g” or “d” to select the
          option I want.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multipart matching. This is useful for autocompleting file paths,
          where I might enter “e/b/a” to autocomplete “env/bin/activate”. ZSH
          does this well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Recursive matching. Since autocompletion sometimes serves dual purpose
          as a quick way to browse options, sometimes you want to start with a
          broad filter and then search within those results. For example, if I
          enter “.pdf” to see all pdf files, I can then hit some key (perhaps
          comma) to start searching within those results, even though what I am
          now typing actually appears in the name before what I typed
          previously.
        </li>
        <li>Spelling correction. This tends to be useful in search engines.</li>
        <li>
          Aliases. When trying to autocomplete a username, the person’s
          first/last name could be allowed to autocomplete to their username.
          The same goes for state abbreviations suggesting the full state.
        </li>
        <li>
          Additional information in the results. If you are autocompleting
          function names, it is nice to see a list of the arguments they take.
        </li>
        <li>
          Context-aware suggestions. This is useful when autocompleting code or
          a word (usually on a mobile phone) where the context is very
          predictive of what the desired result is likely to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make it possible to go back to what I’ve typed after accepting an
          autocomplete suggestion. (The up arrow key tends to be a nice way to
          allow this.)
        </li>
